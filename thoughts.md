## COGS

Cogs are code-modules.  Since flecs already uses the name "module", I don't wan to overload the term

At first, I was thinking that a single code-module could have many cogs, and that other code modules and cogs can reference each other.  As I started to do dynamically loaded code modules, this idea didn't work

So, new idea: One Cog per code-module, and it's just boilerplate and generated by CMake.  It exists and a single register and de-register function is exposed across code boundries.  If statically linked, cogs cannot be unloaded.  

Cogs now expose "Gears", which are the idea of the old cogs.  They are more like Code-Module-Components (once again, the word Component is taken by flecs).  A single code module can create any number of Gears and they are automatically registered by CMake, constructed, and exposed to the rest of the engine.  

So, to recap:

    Cogs -  Code Module objects that are boilerplate generated and automatically registered and activated when a code-module is loaded
    Gears - Code Module Components that are automatically construted when the Cog is, and exposed over the Engine API for any other code modules that wish to reference them.
