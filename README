# Roy Awesome's Open Engine (RAOE)

This is an expiermental game engine written in C++20.  It's a testing ground for game engine ideas, ECS experimentation, scripting integration, and general code layout and design.

I might rename this engine to "Clockwork", since I named the module system "Cogs".
